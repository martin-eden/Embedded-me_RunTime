( Sleep vs Delay

  There are two common names for do-nothing function: "sleep" and
  "delay". For me they are quite different in details.

  Sleep
    - you wanna save battery
    - you have nothing to do now
    - you gonna sleep for a long time (seconds)
    - you've set-up signals that will wake you

  Delay
    - you want high temporal precision
    - you're doing important timing job right now
    - stage is not long (sub-seconds)
    - you've disabled all interrupts

  Wrote parallel implementation of time tracking.
  Almost same code, almost same size -- near 220 lines.

  Looks like this module can't be made simpler.

( Comments I don't yet dare to delete

  /*
    This implementation uses hardware counter 3 (named TC2 in datasheet).

    Main reason for this are interrupts priorities: counter 3 interrupts
    are served before other counters interrupts. In interrupt handler
    you want to have correct time.

    Also it can tick from external signal and stay alive in most sleep
    modes. And has best range of system clock scaling. Which makes me
    think it's suitable for run time tracking and designed for event
    planning.

  /*
    Arduino framework uses:

      * Counter 1 for time tracking

        See <wiring.c>. I don't know why. Ask David Mellis from 2005.

      * Counter 3 for tone() function

        See <Tone.cpp>.

    Our framework uses:

      * Counter 1 for wave generation. See [me_FrequencyGenerator]
      * Counter 2 for signal capture. See [me_DigitalSignalRecorder]
      * Counter 3 for time tracking. See [me_RunTime]
  */

  /*
    Counter used here is simple thing

    It advances from from 0 to 255 every "tick". "Tick" is scaled
    system clock. After 255 it goes to 0 and raises "overflow"
    interrupt flag.
