( Sleep vs Delay

  There are two common names for do-nothing function "sleep" and
  "delay". For me they are quite different in details.

  Sleep
    - you wanna save battery
    - you have nothing to do now
    - you gonna sleep for a long time (seconds)
    - you've set-up signals that will wake you

  Delay
    - you want high temporal precision
    - you're doing important timing job now
    - stage is not long (sub-seconds)
    - you've disabled all interrupts
